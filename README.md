# Drug-Drug Interaction Using XGBoost
Drug-drug interactions 
This project aims to create a machine learning model that can classify drug-drug interactions, given their `SMILES` input

## Pre-requisites
- Jupyter Notebook


## Installation/Steps to run project locally
- Clone the repository `https://github.com/valentina-buoro/outreachy-contributions.git`


## Development Workflow:
- Pre-requisites for development were sucessfully installed
- I explored the TDC dataset catalogue and selected a dataset for classification modelling
- I wrote a python script that downloads the dataset and saves to the `/data` folder
- The data was split into `train, valid and test` for training the machine learning model, carrying out cross validation of the model, and finally testing the model on new data.
- I carried out basic Exploratory Data Analysis to have a better understanding of my dataset
      - The Dataset has 4
- I featurised the model using the *Morgan Fingerprints in binary form* `eos4wt0` from Ersilia Hub
