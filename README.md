## Project Overview

The Blood brain barrier is a selective, semi-permeable membrane that protects the brain and the central nervous system (CNS) from harmful materials in the blood stream. The blood brain barrier permeability of molecules is very important in drug discovery and research, especially in the development of drugs that act on the CNS and also in identifying neurotoxic drugs.
This project is a binary classification machine learning model that will accept the smiles notation of a compound as input and predict the bbb permeability based on the chemical and molecular properties represented in the model. Permeable drugs as predicted are labelled 1 and impermeaple drugs are labelled 0. 

## Dataset Information  

This project uses the **Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability (BBBP) dataset** from [Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC)](https://tdcommons.ai/).  

- **Dataset Name**: BBBP (Martins et al., 2012)  
- **Source**: [TDC BBBP Dataset](https://tdcommons.ai/single_pred_tasks/adme/#bbbp)  
- **Original Research Paper**:  
  Martins, I. F., et al. (2012). A Bayesian approach to in silico bloodâ€“brain barrier penetration modeling. *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 52*(6), 1686-1697. [DOI:10.1021/ci300124c](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci300124c)  

This dataset consists of **1975 molecules**, labeled as **BBB+ (permeable) or BBB- (non-permeable)** based on experimental permeability measurements.
