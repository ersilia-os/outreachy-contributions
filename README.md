## Project Overview

The Blood brain barrier is a selective, semi-permeable membrane that protects the brain and the central nervous system (CNS) from harmful materials in the blood stream. The blood brain barrier permeability of molecules is very important in drug discovery and research, especially in the development of drugs that act on the CNS and also in identifying neurotoxic drugs.
This project is a binary classification machine learning model that will accept the smiles notation of a compound as input and predict the bbb permeability based on the chemical and molecular properties represented in the model. Permeable drugs as predicted are labelled 1 and impermeaple drugs are labelled 0. 

## Dataset Information  

This project uses the **Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability (BBBP) dataset** from [Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC)](https://tdcommons.ai/).  

- **Dataset Name**: BBBP (Martins et al., 2012)  
- **Source**: [TDC BBBP Dataset](https://tdcommons.ai/single_pred_tasks/adme/#bbbp)  
- **Original Research Paper**:  
  Martins, I. F., et al. (2012). A Bayesian approach to in silico bloodâ€“brain barrier penetration modeling. *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 52*(6), 1686-1697. [DOI:10.1021/ci300124c](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci300124c)  

This dataset consists of **1975 molecules**, labeled as **BBB+ (permeable) or BBB- (non-permeable)** based on experimental permeability measurements.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisities

To successfully run this project, the following should be installed:
- Python 3.9 or later
- Ubuntu OS or WSL (If sysyem os is windows)
- Miniconda/Anaconda
- Docker

### Download and Installation: 

To recreate this project, follow these steps:
- Create a fork of this repository
- Open the project repository in your local machine by cloning it:
  ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
      cd your-repo
- Set up the conda environment
  This project uses a conda environment to manage dependencies, create and activate all required dependencies by running:
  ```bash
      conda env create --file environment.yml
      conda activate bbbp
- Download the dataset (Already provided in the data folder):
  The dataset is already split into train, test and valid data and saved as csv files in the data folder. it can be manually downloaded by running the `download_data.py` script
  ```bash
      python scripts/download_data.py
      #this downloads the dataset from Therapeutics Data Commons and saves it in the data folder.

## Featurisation  

The downloaded dataset was featurised, i.e., converted from raw molecular data (SMILES notation) into a numerical representation that can be interpreted by machine learning models.  

The featuriser used is the **RDKit Descriptor Model** from [Ersilia Model Hub](https://www.ersilia.io/model-hub).  

### Steps to Featurise Data:
- Fetch and serve the Ersilia model to be used:  
   ```bash
       ersilia fetch eos8a4x
       ersilia serve eos8a4x
- Run the featurisation script and save featurised data
  ```bash
      python scripts/featurisation.py

This will featurise the split datasets and save the featurised data in the data folder.
